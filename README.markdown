# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

## Overview
This project implements a comprehensive credit card fraud detection system using a combination of batch and real-time data processing, machine learning, and deployment pipelines. The architecture leverages various tools and technologies to ensure efficient data handling, model training, and real-time prediction.

## System Architecture
The system is divided into several key components:

### Data Sources
- **Full Load CSV, Incremental CSV, Real-time Streaming CSV**: Data ingestion from various sources including batch and streaming data.

### Batch ETL and ML
- **Postgres Full Load Table**: Initial data loading into a Postgres database.
- **Jenkin Jobs**: Automated jobs for data extraction and transformation.
  - **Bash Script for Incremental Load**: Incremental data loading process.
  - **Extract Incremental Data by Timestamp**: Extracts data based on timestamps.
- **HDFS Storage**: Stores raw data in Hadoop Distributed File System.
- **Hive Raw Data Table**: Manages raw data in a Hive table.

### Transformation and ML Model Creation
- **Jenkin Jobs**: Orchestrates transformation and model creation tasks.
  - **Full Load Spark Transformations**: Applies transformations on full data loads.
  - **Incremental Transformations**: Applies transformations on incremental data.
  - **ML Model (PySpark)**: Trains a machine learning model using PySpark.
- **Docker Image Build**: Builds Docker images for model deployment.
- **Kubernetes Create Model**: Deploys the trained model using Kubernetes.

### Model in Production
- **ML Model**: The deployed machine learning model for fraud detection.
- **PowerBI Dashboard (Raw Data)**: Visualizes raw data insights.
- **PowerBI (Predicted Data)**: Displays predicted fraud data.

### Real-time ETL and ML
- **FastAPI Service**: Provides a real-time API service.
- **Docker Image Build**: Builds Docker images for real-time processing.
- **Kubernetes Deployed API**: Deploys the API using Kubernetes.
- **Kafka Producer**: Produces real-time data streams.
- **Kafka Consumer**: Consumes and processes real-time data.
- **Jenkin Jobs**: Manages real-time data transformations.
  - **Bash Script for Scala**: Executes Scala scripts for processing.
  - **Extract Incremental Data by Timestamp**: Extracts real-time data by timestamp.
- **Hive Data Table**: Stores processed real-time data.
- **Transformation (PySpark)**: Applies transformations using PySpark.
- **Docker Image Build**: Builds Docker images for real-time predictions.
- **Kubernetes Cronjob**: Schedules periodic prediction jobs.
- **Hive Prediction Results Table**: Stores prediction results.

## Setup and Installation
